Introduction to Statistical Learning with applications in R (ISLR) is a free to download textbook covering topics in machine learning and statistical modeling.
The examples here use Python, Scikit Learn, Seaborn, and clean publicly available datasets to cover the same lessons from the textbook (but in python instead of R).
The book covers much more than what is shown here but it serves as examples for me to revisit once in a while.
